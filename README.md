# Tea Machine
This is the code of the machine you can see on this video :

The machine itself is really simple, everything works with a single servo motor. 
The servo power cables (normally red and brown) is attached to the 5V and GND outputs of the Arduino.
The command cable (normally orange) is attached to pin 9 of the Arduino Uno.
